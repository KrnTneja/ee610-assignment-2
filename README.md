# EE610 Assignment-2

REPORT: <code>report.pdf</code>

The analysis for image given in assignment can be found in the directory <code>./analysis_church/</code>. Analysis for another image of smaller size can be found in the directory <code>./analysis_inbuilt/</code>. Both of these directories use in-built fft function for faster computation.

The same code with FFT function (not naive DFT!) written by me is given in <code>./analysis_self/</code>.

In all these 3 directories, code can be run by using the file <code>./analysis_*/filtering.py</code>.

The GUI can be run using <code>./main.py</code>.
